# pandas-challenge
Create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

The dataset is a table of information about various high schools, including the type of school (district or charter), the number of students, the total school budget, the per student budget, the average math and reading scores, and the percentage of students passing math, reading, and overall. The data was analyzed in order to draw conclusions about the relationship between different factors, such as school type, budget, and student performance.

The data suggests: 

* Charter schools on average have better results when compared to district schools, this can be seen by the higher percentage of passing rates across math, reading and overall passing rate. This could be due to the fact that charter schools have more autonomy in terms of curriculum and budget, which may lead to better educational outcomes.

* Overall, this data suggests that schools with a high per student budget, high total school budget and being a charter school are positively correlated with better educational outcomes in terms of passing rate and scores.

It's important to note that these conclusions are drawn based on the data provided, which could be incomplete or not fully representative of the schools, thus these conclusions should be taken with a grain of salt and further data should be analyzed to support or refute these conclusions.
